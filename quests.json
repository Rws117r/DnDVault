With all five, she would breach a gate into a forgotten faerie dominion, restore her ancient power, and rewrite the balance between human and fairy realms. But the ritual failed. Instead of binding the emotions to herself, they scattered into mortal souls across Dolmenwood — each becoming a cursed host.",
